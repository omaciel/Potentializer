# Potentializer

**Potentializer** is a standalone, simple HTML-based 9-Box Talent Review tool designed for people managers to visually categorize and assess team members' performance and potential.

## About Potentializer

The 9-Box Talent Review is a tool commonly used in performance management and talent planning. It helps managers evaluate their team members based on two dimensions:

- **Performance**: How well an individual meets or exceeds job expectations.
- **Potential**: The individual's ability to grow into more complex roles in the future.

The Potentializer tool offers a straightforward interface where you can input performance and potential data for each team member and automatically assign them to one of nine boxes based on their scores.
